RBM-provisor is an experimental tool, related to Impro-Visor.

It is not currently intended for casual use, but rather
as an exploratory vehicle for learning to generate
jazz melodies using Deep Belief Networks, which are
layered Restricted Boltzmann Machines.

For more explanation of the theory please refer to:

"Learning to Create Jazz Melodies Using Deep Belief Nets"

Notes on RBM-provisor project sources:

If doing GUI work of any kind, please use the Netbeans environment 6.5 or later.

A lot of the GUI Java code is auto-generated by Netbeans. 
If you modify that yourself, it will create many problems and make your source
unusable later on.

If modifying using a text editor outside Netbeans, please familiarize yourself
with Netbeans comment conventions for indicating generated code first.

Thanks.
